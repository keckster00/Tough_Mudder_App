# Tough_Mudder_App

Project Description:
The Tough Mudder App would be a mobile version of the Tough Mudder website, toughmudder.com. The app would allow people who participate in the Tough Mudder races to access their account information, race registrations, event info, and other functions without having to go to the website directly and login every time.

Features: 
Login: The user will be able to login to the app using an email and a password
Encryption: The passwords will be encrypted
Race Information: Users can find out about all the different events offered
Race Registration: The user will be able to view future events and register for them within the app
Access Event Info: Users will be able to access their race ticket and race map through the app
Photos: Users will be able to access their race photos after the event
Race tims: Users will be able to access their race times for qualifying races after the event
Tough Mudder Store: Users can view items and purchase them from the Tough Mudder online store in-app
Training: Users can learn about and sign up for the Tough Mudder Race Training plan in-app
